# SoapVersion

## What is SoapVersion?
Have you ever used a soap service and suddenly they change something and because of that you miss data?

## What does it do.
It allows teams or developers to add soap services to the dashboard and version the result set of selected function from that soap service.
This is done by adding static data for the specific function.

It is expected for the function that it always should return the same result set when the data sent to the soap function stays the same.

### But why when you can ask the external party to ask for a change?
Well in my position I got the best answer in the world.

> We did not change anything, are you sure it worked like that before.

As you can imagine as a developer of a company who has not always worked on that specific project I could not provide the evidence that it always worked how I expected, but I believe my co-workers a bit more than an external party.
