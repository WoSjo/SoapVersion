# Modules

## DI

The di module allows users to manage bindings between the complete application.
Out of the box we will use laravel's.

## Router

The router module should be able to extend main router package that we can 
provide of information using a service class that implements a `BaseRouterInterface`.

## Validation

The validation package will check if the input that has been given in is correct and will return it.
It will also return the errors.

## View engine.

This will implement an existing view engine but put a service and interface between the modules and repository.

### More to come.

While building the application the list will be expanded with more modules.
